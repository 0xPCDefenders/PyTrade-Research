    "This algorithm is a short-term trading strategy based off the moving average indicator. Utilizing moving average compares the velocity of price movement between distinct periods of time. If the moving average of a period with the shorter time window is greater than the period with the larger window, this indicates that the price is currently experiencing an upwards trend which should incentivize buying pressure.
